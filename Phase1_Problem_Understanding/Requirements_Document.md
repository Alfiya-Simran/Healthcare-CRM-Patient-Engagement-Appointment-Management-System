# Requirements Document â€“ Healthcare CRM

## Problem Statement
Hospitals and clinics handle thousands of patient inquiries through phone calls, websites, and walk-ins.  
Currently:
- Appointment booking is manual.  
- Follow-ups are inconsistent.  
- Patient medical history is scattered.  
- No real-time visibility into hospital performance.  

This leads to long waiting times, missed follow-ups, and poor patient satisfaction.

## Requirements
1. Patients should be able to book appointments digitally.  
2. Doctors should only see their assigned patients and schedules.  
3. Receptionists should register new patients and manage bookings.  
4. Automatic SMS/email reminders should be sent for appointments.  
5. Admins should get dashboards for patient inflow, doctor utilization, and performance metrics.  
6. Medical history and prescriptions should be stored digitally.  
7. The system should prevent duplicate patient records.  

## Industry-Specific Challenges
- Long waiting times due to manual workflows.  
- Missed follow-ups leading to poor patient engagement.  
- Compliance with healthcare data security and privacy.  
- Lack of real-time analytics for decision-making.
