## Healthcare-CRM-Patient-Engagement-Appointment-Management-System
Hospitals and clinics handle thousands of patient inquiries through phone calls, websites, and walk-ins. However, appointment booking is manual, follow-ups are inconsistent, and patient medical history is scattered across systems. This leads to long waiting times, missed follow-ups, and poor patient engagement.

**To address this, the healthcare provider wants to implement a Salesforce CRM to:**

- Automate patient appointment booking and reminders via SMS/email

- Manage doctor schedules and availability in real time

- Track patient records, prescriptions, and treatment history

- Enable dashboards for administrators to monitor patient inflow, doctor utilization, and overall hospital performance

**Target Users: Patients, Doctors, Reception Staff, Hospital Admins**

**Use Cases:**

1. Patient Appointment Booking

2. Doctor Schedule Management

3. Automated Reminders & Follow-ups

4. Medical History Tracking

5. Hospital Performance Dashboards
